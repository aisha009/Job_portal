	<p>The University of Sindh, the oldest University of the country, was constituted under the University of Sindh Act. No. XVII of 1947 passed by the Legislative Assembly of Sindh. The Act was subsequently revised and modified in 1961 and later. The Act of 1972 under which the University is presently functioning provided for greater autonomy and representation of teachers .</p>
	<p>From 1947 to 1951 the University functioned solely as an examining body. However, after its relocation in Hyderabad in 1951, it started functioning as a teaching university in pursuit of fulfillment of its charter and mission to disseminate knowledge; the first teaching department, namely, Department of Education, raised to the status of Faculty of Education later, was started in view of the great dearth of trained teachers in the country. The departments of basic Science disciplines as well as other departments on humanities side were added by mid fifties.</p>
	<p>The development of the present Campus at Jamshoro, about 15 kilometer from Hyderabad on the right bank of River Indus now designated as Allama I.I. Kazi Campus, was started in late fifties. Most of the teaching departments under the Faculty of Science were shifted to the new campus in 1961, with departments under Arts & Humanities following suite in 1970.</p>
	
	<p>The academic march forward continued with the gradual addition of other teaching departments and now there are 43 full-fledged teaching institutes/centres/departments functioning under various academic Faculties. Institute of Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering and Centre for Environmental Sciences are the latest addition.</p>
    <p>There are presently 4 Law Colleges and 74 Degree and Post Graduate Colleges (including 16 Private Colleges) affiliated to the University.
Programs of Studies:</p>
<p>Academic Faculties of the University impart teaching leading to the Bachelor (Honours) and Master degrees and provide research guidance for the M.Phil and Ph.D. programs. The teaching and research under the Faculties of Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Arts, Education, Islamic Studies, Commerce & Business Administration is directly imparted by the University.</p>
<p>Each Faculty works under the Dean, appointed by the Chancellor for a term of 3 years. The University teaching departments, institutes and centres offer programs leading to the award of 3- year Bachelor’s (Honours) degree in various general and basic disciplines on Humanities side while 4- year Bachelor degree is offered under the Faculty of Natural Sciences. The degrees have been redesignated accordingly indicating discipline e.g for Computer Science BC (CS) and Information Technology BS(IT) etc.</p>
<p>The Masters’ degree programs are of 1- year duration after Honours and of 2 -year duration after Bachelor (Pass) degrees.</p>
<p>The 2- year Bachelor’s (Pass) degree programs are conducted through various affiliated Degree Colleges within the jurisdiction of the University.

The teaching under the Faculty of Law is conducted through the affiliated professional Law colleges.</p>
  <p>Degree programs in the Evening shift introduced since 2002 include Masters degrees in English and Information Technology- related disciplines such as E-commerce and Multimedia Technology.</p>
  <p>Many teaching departments under various Faculties of the University also offer Postgraduate 1 year Diploma as well as short term Certificate programs.</p>
  <p>Some of the degree colleges in private sector and affiliated to the University, also offer 3-year, Hons. & Master’s programs.</p>
