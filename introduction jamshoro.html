	<h1>Introduction to Jamshoro</h1>"

	<p>Jamshoro, the site of largest University residential campus in the country, situated about 18 kilometers from Hyderabad on the right bank of River Indus, was a rather desolate hilly track until 1955 when it was selected for the establishment of Sindh University Campus. The site was selected to be a University township away from the humdrum of Hyderabad city which lacked room to meet the ambitious expansion programs of the University.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Jamshoro is virtually the gate-way to the Indus Valley, now world famous for its civilization and rich cultural heritage. The Ranikot Fort is located 40 km. to the north of the campus, in the northward continuation of the same hilly track which become Laki Ranges, merging with the Khirthars northwards. Amri, an important archeological site, lies about 15 km. further north. Sehwan, a well known township lies 25 km. to the north of Amri. Mancher Lake the largest fresh water lake in the region, is situated to the west north west of Sehwan. Travelling about 150 km. north through the Indus plains brings one to the site of Moen-jo-Daro, the most important archeological discovery of the Valley.</p>
<p>The development programs initiated in 1959 have gradually though slowly borne fruit. Though still in progress, over the years about 20 teaching blocks, housing 39 institutes departments and centers have been constructed. Five halls of students residence provide accommodation for about 1800 students. A beautiful pavilion-the Hyder Bux Jatoi Pavilion has been constructed to provide indoor games facility, track for athletics and sports grounds. Fatima Jinnah Gymnasium provides games and sports facility exclusively for girls. The Institute of Sindhology building, depicting the cultural heritage of Sindh, adores the entrance to the campus from the Highway. The imposing central library building, named after Late Allama I. I.Kazi, the first Vice-chancellor of the University at Hyderabad, who conceptualized this campus, serves as a land mark even from a distance.The campus itself has been named as Allama I.I. Kazi Campus as a tribute to the great scholar and visionary.</p>
<p>The residential Colony for the faculty and staff of the University provides on campus residence to about one third of the employees. Plans are in hand to expand the colony and provide accommodation at the campus to 200 more employees.</p>
<p>The tree lined roads and greenery developed at the campus has completely transformed the site. The location of Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, sharing the site with the Sindh University and the Liaquat University of Medicine & Health Sciences complex in the neighborhood, has gone a long way in this transformation to a University township.

</p>
<p>The University, because of its easy accessibility, thanks to the construction of Super Highway and Hyderabad Bypass, being about 150 km. from Karachi and 18 km. from Hyderabad, has been able to host a number of International Conferences, Symposia and Seminars on Science & Education and on specialized scientific themes. Intervarsity sports competitions and annual sports meets have become regular features. The museum and various art galleries of the Institute of Sindhology attract a large number of visitors.
